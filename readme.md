# Crossy Turtle Python Game

## Description

This is a spin off the Crossy Road games, except its in 2D and here the turtle has to cross the road without being hit by traffic.

Once you reach the top of the screen the speed of the cars increases and you start at the bottom again.

I don't think anyone will make it past level 10 with current settings as is.

Challenge accepted - This was so much fun to try and figure out all the different things and to get it working.
